# MakeFolder
Automate Making lots of folders!
Specificly tailored for a single client.


•	Path: C:\.........\This Week<br />
•	Make a new folder, Name it New Folder<br />
•	Add two subfolders<br />
•	Name them Data and Documents<br />
•	Make a new folder in Data called Excel<br />
•	Repeat above  n times<br />
<br>
This project is meant to be simple.<br>
I was given two goals on this project<br>
1. To keep the code very simple so the client could expand their own python knoledge and develop this further on their own.
2. To allow them to create folders int he style they desired.
